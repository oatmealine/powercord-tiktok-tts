### I am no longer interested in maintaining the legacy Replugged version, and I'd highly recommend heading over to see the progress on the [Replugged rewrite](https://github.com/oatmealine/replugged-tiktok-tts) as I figure out the new APIs.

# tiktok-tts [![Install with Replugged](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Install%20with&style=flat-square&message=Replugged&color=7289da)](https://replugged.dev/install?url=oatmealine/powercord-tiktok-tts)

A powercord plugin that lets you speak Discord messages with the TikTok TTS API, originally discovered by [@scanlime](https://twitter.com/scanlime). _This may break at any time as the API is undocumented._
